First, in your host machine, run the script file named "./run_image"
Second, in your container bash, cd to mapped directory, in this case, it's /home/
After that, run file ./install_rails (just 1 time, for installing rails and create your project) then ./start_webserver

Afterward, everytime you need to start web server, just run ./run_image and ./start_webser only

If you wanna save the state of container (all installed packages), then follow these instructions:
	1. exit
	2. in host machine use: docker ps -a to get image ID
	3. docker commit <ID>
